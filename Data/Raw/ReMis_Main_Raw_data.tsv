Occurs in some of the projects"	The data-related mistakes are often very different: from missing to code a relevant variable to errors in a script. In the vast majority of cases the errors are detected during the piloting period and are corrected for the final experiment.	In almost all cases this happens when projects are handled by Master students or first year PhD students. A much more specified protocol, and in written form, of how to prepare an experimental paradigm, the different aspect to double check before running and while running the subjects would avoid these errors.

The post-doc was expert in the main technique used but not on the topic and on the other imaging technique used. He was trained on the new technique for a few subjects but more supervision would have been necessary through the whole process due to these reasons.	"Major

Then later to data-related mistakes. Not sure if the later ones are also about data management. For me a data-related mistake could be produced by a typo in a data manipulation script. This can lead to mistaken results. And this can happen on a fairly frequent basis. As for data management, I instruct all my students to write script that takes the raw file, does all data manipulation and produces the results reported in the paper. There is no copy pasting of any kind involved in the workflow.

Or, questions will be programmed in a set order and Qualtrics will change the order that the questions are presented.	No clue. We never analyze the scale data when this happens and often re-run the study by some other means (e.g., Prolific and/or in-person).	"Very Low

I have a certain way of dummy coding in that the experimental condition is coded as a zero while the control condition is coded as a one. A graduate student who I work with prefers the opposite.

Letting students make those data working mistakes, to show them how careful you actually need to be is more a life-lesson for them, than a mistake by the ""research team""."	Being time poor is the primary cause. I do all my own programming and the primary reason why errors sometimes occur is that I have insufficient time to take due care when checking and double-checking both the program and the data files to ensure that everything is programmed correctly and recording correctly.  These don't happen that often, but often enough that if I had more time, I would spend more time in the double-triple checking phase before opening the study up to participants.	"Low

I recorded where on the screen participants clicked, but somehow managed to not record which image was where on which trial, so I couldn't actually triangulate back to the image chosen on each trial.	In this instance I used a programming technique to randomise the images that I hadn't used in this context before and, due to a lack of available time, it was the student who double-checked the output rather than me and failed to recognise that these data were not recorded (although even had I checked it, I may not have immediately noticed, since I've never before come across a way of coding in that program that doesn't result in every event of a trial being recorded.

Occurs in some of the projects"	I see the biggest risk in the first phase when you (often alone, would be better to be two so that one or the other might notice mistakes more easily) prepare the data for analysis; e.g. preparations/calculations of variables with large data sets. I find this a difficult and time consuming task, with potential for human errors. We try to document the steps and use syntaxes, but still, I find it difficult to document in such a way that it would be easy enough to retrace all steps in complex cases. Also, the work load and stress increase the risk for mistakes.	Human errors, mistakes. We often double check and thus might find the errors, however, if such errors sometimes occur, it leads me to fear whether a mistake might have happened that we have not noticed.	"Low

Occurs in half of the projects"	Most mistakes I can think of had to do with data analysis or reporting of results. For example, during the data analysis, I might have used a filter and then forgotten to remove it. Or another researcher might have made mistakes in their R code, specifying a wrong subset or a wrong variable. With regards to reporting, I think it happens quite often that people copy-paste text to save time and then forget to change some values. Or that they make rounding and other errors when re-typing values.	I think that such mistakes are expected to happen. So, I like the idea of having some automated way to check for them, e.g., via statcheck. I do think though that there are some factors that contribute to inattentiveness. One is a pressure to work fast and deliver results in a short time frame. I have seen people send reports of results at 2am - I bet they were under stress, tired, and not well-focused when running those analyses (and indeed that is one case where there was a major mistake in the visual representation of data).

Example: Have to rerun the analysis."	time loss	NA	I already gave an example of problems with data analysis. So, I'll describe another big problem I personally had during data collection. Last year I planned a diary study, which included two follow-ups one week and two weeks after the end of the diary. I used the services of a company that allows you to send surveys to participants' mobile phones and to schedule the surveys so that they are sent automatically. The last part of my data collection happened in August. There was an error in their system and my last follow-ups were not sent. I noticed relatively fast but it took them days to figure out what was wrong and still the problem was not resolved. This was a source of big frustration and also caused money and data loss.	To my understanding, there was an error in their system which made it so that all schedules were moved by one day. So, when participants should have received the last daily survey, it appeared as if they were already finished with the study (and  received nothing). Again, though, I think this is a problem that could have been solved if someone paid attention. So, there was the additional issue that it was during summer holidays and there was no one that could respond fast to solve the problem.	"Moderate

The results and p values or F values did not change, and luckily the paper she wrote was rejected at the first journal that I could go over the stats and found out the mistake. I was not sure if she did it because it was easies, or mistakingly. Now I go over everything she does with a double or triple check, and am rather unreluctant to write with her.

Occurs never or rarely"	1. I selected the wrong sample for an analysis.   2. Project staff assessed students with the incorrect version of one of the measures.  3. In a data set provided from an external source, the data manager miscalculated three variables. I believe she forgot to reverse-code some of the items for their respective scales.   4. Data sets occasionally contain duplicate entries for a survey or other assessment.  5. Our data manager, in consultation with other investigators, chose to change the treatment condition for individuals who moved between groups with different assignment. For example, if an individual was assigned to a group in the treatment condition but then moved to a group in the control condition, the condition variable was changed.	1. I copied the analysis code used for a previous paper, and failed to adjust the sample selection statement. The error was detected and fixed before the results were presented to the project investigator and well before the paper was submitted for publication.   2. The school where assessments took place adopted a newer version of the assessment, and the new version was accidentally administered.   3. User error. The data manager simply forgot to recode items. The items were quickly recoded and the scales rescored.   4. Duplicate entries usually occur when an assessment is entered (e.g., by hand, scanned) more than once. We routinely check for duplicate cases, so these were dropped--removed from the data for analysis.  5. The change in assignment variable was due to an inexperienced data manager and, more importantly, two inexperienced investigators who did not understand the principle of intention to treat. The assignment variable was changed back to its original state before any analyses were started.	"Very Low

My team and I employ a wide array of techniques to ensure accurate analysis and interpretation of the data, which we developed over the past 30 years. Analysts typically participate in the research design and measure selection process; review relevant literature to understand the research project, its goals, and its outcomes; attend project management meetings to understand procedures for assessments, intervention delivery, and related activities; and review data entry and coding procedures. This allows us to understand what the data should look like, so we can better recognize any errors. We then expend considerable effort reviewing the data to ensure we have the expected sample sizes, expected range of values for each variable, and so on. As a consequence, errors seldom perpetuate through to reports, manuscripts, or presentations.   For example, in preparing data from an observation system, we began with a complete understanding of the goals of the observations. We then prepared the complicated data set, scoring key variables and verifying them with hand calculations. Next, we reported descriptive statistics as well as the highest and lowest three scores on each variable and asked the observation team to review their records to ensure the sample size and values we calculated matched their expectations for the specific observations we provided.

I would certainly not draw any conclusions from data from this survey. The construct of data management error is poorly defined, same as research group and team. If the point was to prove that yes, people make mistakes and there are always negative consequences, than yes, you hit the brief. But then again, why ask what you already know? You might want to consider a new way of getting to the bottom of this, because the topic is important enough.
