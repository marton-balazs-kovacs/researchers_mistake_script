Letting students make those data working mistakes, to show them how careful you actually need to be is more a life-lesson for them, than a mistake by the ""research team""."	Being time poor is the primary cause. I do all my own programming and the primary reason why errors sometimes occur is that I have insufficient time to take due care when checking and double-checking both the program and the data files to ensure that everything is programmed correctly and recording correctly.

I recorded where on the screen participants clicked, but somehow managed to not record which image was where on which trial, so I couldn't actually triangulate back to the image chosen on each trial.	In this instance I used a programming technique to randomise the images that I hadn't used in this context before and, due to a lack of available time, it was the student who double-checked the output rather than me and failed to recognise that these data were not recorded (although even had I checked it, I may not have immediately noticed, since I've never before come across a way of coding in that program that doesn't result in every event of a trial being recorded.

R_QaFTHFdsxfpvsFb	Moderate	Most mistakes I can think of had to do with data analysis or reporting of results. For example, during the data analysis, I might have used a filter and then forgotten to remove it. Or another researcher might have made mistakes in their R code, specifying a wrong subset or a wrong variable. With regards to reporting, I think it happens quite often that people copy-paste text to save time and then forget to change some values. Or that they make rounding and other errors when re-typing values.	I think that such mistakes are expected to happen. So, I like the idea of having some automated way to check for them, e.g., via statcheck. I do think though that there are some factors that contribute to inattentiveness. One is a pressure to work fast and deliver results in a short time frame. I have seen people send reports of results at 2am - I bet they were under stress, tired, and not well-focused when running those analyses (and indeed that is one case where there was a major mistake in the visual representation of data).	Moderate	Minor	time loss	I already gave an example of problems with data analysis. So, I'll describe another big problem I personally had during data collection. Last year I planned a diary study, which included two follow-ups one week and two weeks after the end of the diary. I used the services of a company that allows you to send surveys to participants' mobile phones and to schedule the surveys so that they are sent automatically. The last part of my data collection happened in August. There was an error in their system and my last follow-ups were not sent. I noticed relatively fast but it took them days to figure out what was wrong and still the problem was not resolved. This was a source of big frustration and also caused money and data loss.	To my understanding, there was an error in their system which made it so that all schedules were moved by one day. So, when participants should have received the last daily survey, it appeared as if they were already finished with the study (and  received nothing). Again, though, I think this is a problem that could have been solved if someone paid attention. So, there was the additional issue that it was during summer holidays and there was no one that could respond fast to solve the problem.	Moderate	frustration	social psychology	4

In a data set provided from an external source, the data manager miscalculated three variables. I believe she forgot to reverse-code some of the items for their respective scales.   4. Data sets occasionally contain duplicate entries for a survey or other assessment.  5. Our data manager, in consultation with other investigators, chose to change the treatment condition for individuals who moved between groups with different assignment. For example, if an individual was assigned to a group in the treatment condition but then moved to a group in the control condition, the condition variable was changed.	1. I copied the analysis code used for a previous paper, and failed to adjust the sample selection statement. The error was detected and fixed before the results were presented to the project investigator and well before the paper was submitted for publication.   2. The school where assessments took place adopted a newer version of the assessment, and the new version was accidentally administered.   3. User error. The data manager simply forgot to recode items. The items were quickly recoded and the scales rescored.   4. Duplicate entries usually occur when an assessment is entered (e.g., by hand, scanned) more than once. We routinely check for duplicate cases, so these were dropped--removed from the data for analysis.  5. The change in assignment variable was due to an inexperienced data manager and, more importantly, two inexperienced investigators who did not understand the principle of intention to treat. The assignment variable was changed back to its original state before any analyses were started.

Could be solved by better communication, but easy to forget to email the relevant colleague with the new file version.	Poor communication when things get stressed.	High	Minor	time loss	I have only been researching for a year, so I don’t have a lot to compare with. I guess I would say the most serious data mistake was when I believed I had used a bonferroni correction on some pair wise comparisons and written the entire thing up in the results section. I then noticed that those values could not have been the corrected ones and we had to rewrite a large part of our discussion draft after I corrected the mistake.

This was more of a hiccup than a mistake, but by specifying the data incorrectly prior to a giant imputation that was going to take days, we realized when the parameters of certain variables were surprising that something odd must've happened.

R_3L6niGuAekVeaXx	Moderate	over the years I have seen the following: -overlapping participant numbers between different groups, means no one knows what disorder which participant has.  -missing demographic information, e.g. age, gender, BMI for anorexia -quick programming leading to errors in saving data (e.g. just half the task is recorded) -people loosing data analyses they spend months on -badly programmed .exe task files that do not represent what was said in papers (you have to dig deep into C decompiling to notice this)	info:most of the problems occur if either too many people are involved in analysing the same datasets (e.g. large labs in which data is reused over and over) or when people are not given enough time to think about their task when having to program it. and then you also have people who have to program tasks even though they have never done it before and no one checks it. bad management really.	Moderate	Major	all of this can happen if no one checks-finds it. in ours mainly time loss due to some smart people finding it just before article publication	I see them all as quite serious. worst was wrong task programming which just was noticed when I was given the data to write up. when digging into the methods I noticed that RTs are fixed and varied only by a refreshrate-the previous guy just said it is singificant and wanted it to be published. so no, task had to be reprogrammed and new data had to be collected.	giving tasks that require expertise (data management, programming, analyses) to undergraduates-master students without checking it. again, bad management in my opinion + probably time pressure.

But the mistake was discovered through running descriptive statistics and could be corrected.	In the data download, only 6 points of a 7-point Likert Skale were recorded.	Low	Insignificant	time loss	"I'm not sure I understand the question: ""Could you write down the most serious data-related mistake that happened years in your team in the last 5 years?"""	Not sure if I'm supposed to report about another mistake here than the one described above.	NA	NA	other	16
R_0ibVXbAiuoWoMWR	Very Low	I don't use labs, so the most concerning issue for me is when people 'game' MTurk and it can be hard to tell if the data from one individual is used multiple times (they take the survey more than once).	Not catching these individuals.	Moderate	Moderate	financial loss, time loss, and frustration	None that I can think of.	NA	Insignificant	na	other	9
R_3EKM0va9ntRVGxm	Low	As I process data to reduce the number of variables, I can leave out a variable that I later realize I need. Also, if I have failed to document fully when I delete full observations.	Insufficient foresight.	Very Low	Moderate	time loss	Failure to document why some observations were deleted from full administrative data file.	Carelessness.	Moderate	erroneous conclusion	other	35
R_4Jx85V7Q7juO0rD	Very Low	A calculated variable was not properly coded.	Lack of consistency in the names of the variables across experiments led to the mistake	Very Low	Major	We have to write an erratum	We discovered the mistake a week ago. We published inaccurate data (in a registered report, in one exploratory analysis - which did not change the conclusions). We are currently writing the erratum.

R_vOfSDKH9m5bsxQl	Low	Datasets are not always saved in one place, and - especially a few years - most often on people's own computers. This means that various versions of the 'same' set may be in existence, or datasets get lost (e.g. when a researcher leaves to another institute).	An insufficiently formalized data management protocol; the IT-services do not facilitate easy and safe access to data	Low	Moderate	frustration	Probably the failure to record part of the responses of some participants	Insufficient experimental design	Moderate	frustration	applied psychology	5
