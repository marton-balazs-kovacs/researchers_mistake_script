We caught the error and retrieved the data before a permanent loss occurred.   Another type of error was solved by using dual letter/numeric participant names... AB101,  BC102, CD103, DE104, etc.  we began this about 10 years ago.  Subsequently incorrect entries went to near zero and were easily caught.	out of timeframe
