R_SHwFOwZ6VkkfpPr	serious	This was before my time, on a project I was not involved in, but I heard that one time the experimental group was coded as 0 and the comparison coded as 1. These designations are of course arbitrary but the conventionally they are coded the other way around. This led to the exact opposite conclusions.	serious	Extreme
R_2QopNHjyyr0Mqmt	serious	Experimental software did not store all experimental condition labels when exporting results.	serious	Major
R_u3udJvSlp9H0lYR	serious	Th most serious data-related mistake was missing items from a measure that should have been included in data collection. However, this was a secondary measure and not primary outcome.	serious	Minor

R_T1L5jxO15Adwh0d	serious	This was more of a hiccup than a mistake, but by specifying the data incorrectly prior to a giant imputation that was going to take days, we realized when the parameters of certain variables were surprising that something odd must've happened. It required an additional week of work and delayed us and was frustrating and made us question our trust in the person who made the mistake.	serious	Moderate

R_wQKtnSahMtTdwZP	serious	After I entered all the data, when I was analysing the data, I realised I made a mistake. So, I had to introduce all the data again. I lost time, and it was frustrating. Luckily, I did not publish anything with the wrong data	serious	Moderate

R_a9Gz8zHhb9u2pW1	serious	lack of version control, leading to difficulty with identifying which pre-processed data were the relevant data in an output (i.e. having various versions of summary data but not being quite sure which one related to a particular outcome).

R_2e295rrs3RwuezQ	serious	1 participant out of 300 was MRI-scanned under a different number, and therefore not correctly linked to questionnaires (it was 2 instead of 1 subject). This kept recurring in multiple analyses as nobody was allowed to change the raw MRI data files.	serious	Insignificant
R_2dvcIJA7IFmsu14	serious	I don't know if it counts as a data-related mistake, but we've had to re-run entire studies due to errors in experimental randomisation, e.g. not randomising something we thought we were randomising, or making a mistake in a complex randomisation.	serious	Major
